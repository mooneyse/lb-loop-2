| Loop 1     |
+------------+

- This takes...
  (1) A list of sources.
  (2) A list of subbands to be imaged (or the LoTSS catalogue for the field).
- For one batch of sources...
  (1) Get the LBCS (and other bright) sources.
  (2) For each source, make a small dataset and run loop 2, getting the returned source models.
  (3) Subtract the sources for the unaveraged (1 s, 16 ch/sb) data.
  (4) Update the global phase/amplitude solution table.
- For subsequent batches of sources (which are the next layer, down to ~mJy)...
  (1) Make a small dataset. (The subtracted data from the first run are used.)
  (2) Correct each dataset with the global phase solution table. (The phase solutions from the first run are used.)
  (3) Run loop 2 for each source. Loop 2 will update the global solution table and write out maps of the sources.

| Loop 2     |
+------------+

- This takes...
  (1) A dataset on a single source.
- Imaging and self-calibration are done by loop 3.
- The global phase solution HDF5 table is updated.*

Loop 2A: - Get the current phase solution table at this position.
         - Get the data at low resolution (1 s, 12 ch/sb).
         - Get the closure phase statistic for each station. (This is a proxy for the flux available on different baselines.)
         - Get the required size of the map of the source. (Look at LoTSS or FIRST. 20" < size < 2'. Pixel size = 0.1".)

Loop 2B: - Get the initial model.
           1. Look at the closure phase statistics from loop 2.
           2. Work out the maximum coherent baseline length.
           3. If the source is resolved in LoTSS:
                  Use this as the initial model.
              Else:
                  Run the model engine.
                  Use the model engine return value to assess if a two-component model is acceptable.
                  If it is acceptable:
                      Accept the model.
                  Else:
                      Image the data with the maximum of the 80 km baselines and the maximum coherent baseline length.
         - Run WSClean (imaging) and phase self-calibration (loop 3) (5 iterations), beginning at the maximum coherent baseline length and finishing at 800 km.**
         - Run amplitude self-calibration (1 iteration) if coherent solutions are obtained from Loop 3 on almost all stations in the final iteration.
         - Average the dataset, if needed.
         - Store the CORRECTED_DATA and the image.
         - Return the longest baseline that was phase-calibrated.

*  This loop runs in parallel.
   Updating the global phase solution table simulatneously may not be possible.
   Temporary storage may be required.
   The global phase solution table has entries as a function of...
   (1) Position.
   (2) Station.
   Generating a solution table at a particular point is a common task.
   Different stations can have different origins.
   (e.g. The DE601 solution could come from an LBCS calibrator, modified b incremental solutions on a closer and fainter source.
         The UK608 solution could come from an LBCS calibrator only.)

** If coherent solutions are being obtained on the longest baselines imaged, and the total image flux obtained does not start to decrease significantly.
   Each run of loop 3 adds to the global phase calibration table.

+------------+
| Loop 3     |
+------------+

- This does phase self-calibration on a single source.
- It updates the global phase solution table.

+------------+
| Questions  |
+------------+

1. Loop 2 outputs h5parms local to each source, and then at the end they're all applied to the global solutions table - or are these h5parms output by loop 3?
2. Loop 3 takes care of WSClean as well as self-calibration.

  What would be really useful is all the bits for...
  - Finding the best phase solutions (i.e. pick the closest calibrator from a list of calibrators) for a direction.
  - Apply those phase solutions.
  - Run loop 3.
  - Take the  final instrument table from loop 3.
  - Generate a new 'best phase solutions' for that direction, which will be a combination of the input and final instrument tables.
  So all the infrastructure for accessing phase tables, adding phase solutions together, writing them back, is a good place to start.
